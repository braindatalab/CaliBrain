## Overview

**CaliBrain** is a Python framework for uncertainty estimation and calibration in EEG/MEG inverse source imaging.

It supports both:
- **Regression tasks** (continuous source estimates)
- **Classification tasks** (binary activation detection)

**Key Features**:
- Setup of source space, BEM model, forward solution, and leadfield matrices.
- Simulation of source activity and sensor-level measurements with controllable noise and source orientation (fixed or free).
- Solving the inverse problem and reconstructing source time courses.
- Estimation and visualization of confidence intervals.
- Calibration analysis by comparing expected vs. observed confidence levels.

### Supported Inverse Methods
- Gamma-MAP
- eLORETA
- Bayesian Minimum Norm

## Calibration Tasks

### 1. Regression (Confidence Interval Calibration)
- Check if true simulated source currents fall within predicted confidence intervals.
- Plot calibration curve (Expected vs. Observed coverage).
- Well-calibrated models should follow the diagonal.

### 2. Classification (Activation Calibration)
- Assess if estimated activation probabilities match true activation frequencies.
- Plot calibration curve for activation detection.
- Ideal calibration follows the diagonal.
