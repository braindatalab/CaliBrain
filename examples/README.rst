CaliBrain Examples
==========================

This gallery contains practical examples demonstrating real-world applications 
of CaliBrain for brain source localization and uncertainty quantification.

These examples show complete workflows that you can adapt for your own research 
projects. Each example is a standalone script that can be run independently.

**Quick Start**: If you're new to CaliBrain, start with the benchmarking experiment 
to see how different algorithms compare on simulated data.
